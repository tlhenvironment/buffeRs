# buffeRs
buffeRs generates non-circular simple feature geometries e.g. for the use as buffers in model-building.

- `buffer_wedge()` creates a wedge-shaped geometry
- `buffer_semicircle()` creates a semicircular geometry
- `buffer_windrose()` creates a windrose shaped geometry
- `buffer_rectangle()` creates a rectangular shaped geometry
- `buffer_square()` creates a square shaped geometry


# Installation
Install from CRAN with `install.packages("buffeRs")`
